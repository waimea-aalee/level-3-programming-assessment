# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## Movement

Rooms should all be accessible so exit is possible to get to

### Test Data To Use

A screenshot showing the exit in the game shows that it is possible

### Expected Test Result

User should be able to exit and then say they have escaped the school

---

## Invalid movement

The user should not be able to make invalid moves, going into a room that has no access

### Test Data To Use

Screenshot of the greyed out directions they are not able to be used 

### Expected Test Result

The user should be kept in the same room until a valid move is made
